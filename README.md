Kafka Streams Word Count Application

## Synopsis
The Java application will read sentences from the sentences topic in Kafka and will count the amount of times each word has appeared in all the sentences. Then it will stream the latest count for each word into the word-count topic, which we will read with a Kafka console consumer.
